# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Yassine Bazgour

AI & Data Science student who talks to machines more than people.
I build stuff that thinks, moves, and occasionally predicts the future â€” from smart stethoscopes to stupid dermatologists.
A wise man once said: "If itâ€™s not solving a real-world problem, itâ€™s a piece of shitâœ¨."
